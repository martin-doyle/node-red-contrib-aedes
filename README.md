MQTT Broker for Node-RED based on [Aedes](https://github.com/moscajs/aedes).

You can use the MQTT protocol in Node-Red without an external MQTT broker like Mosquitto.

## Background
This node was created because the original MQTT broker [node-red-contrib-mqtt-broker](https://github.com/zuhito/node-red-contrib-mqtt-broker) uses [mosca](https://github.com/moscajs/mosca) which is no longer maintained.
## Installation
You can install the node directly within the editor by using the [Palette Manager](https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/editor/palette/manager).

To install the node from the command-line, you can use the following command from within your user data directory (by default, ```$HOME/.node-red```):
```sh
npm install node-red-contrib-aedes
```
## Flows
Just put this node on Node-RED and hit the deploy button. The MQTT Broker will run on your Node-RED instance.
